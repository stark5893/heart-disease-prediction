# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using various classification models. This project includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and comparison of results with visualizations.

## 📊 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- XGBoost

## 📁 Dataset
Used the dataset from online

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC Score

## 📉 Model Performance Comparison
